This addon represents an alternative approach to wrapping OpenCV for openFrameworks. It is being designed for openFrameworks 007+ compatibility only. My first goal is to have a small but complete substitute for ofxOpenCv, at which point I will start versioning releases. Until then, I don't recommend that anyone use it directly.
